Hi, I'm Dipper. I'm a Computer Science undergraduate. My interests include privacy, security and data analysis. Contributing to open-source projects is also something I'm very passionate about. If you meet me away from my desk, I'd probably be drinking coffee or telling you about how [Charlie Kaufman](https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/charlie-kaufman) movies are the pinnacle of creative expression.

If you'd like to know what I'm studying at university, here's a brief overview:
